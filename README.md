# NCAA and NBA Player Stats and Their Relation to Salary

This R notebook takes all player stats from their time in the NCAA and NBA from 1985 to 2018 and compares some key player statistics from both leauges and identifies which have the most impact on that player's average salary throughout their career in the NBA. It contains instances of data wrangling, data visualization, basic modeling using ggplot, and data analysis to form conclusions based on the visualized data.

This project is a practice in overall data wrangling and using detailed data visualization to form conclusions based off of large sets of data.

This repository contains a .Rmd file with all of the R code and comments readable and editable with RStudio as well as a .nb.html file that contains the .Rmd in a readable format without the use of RStudio.
